## Cherry Picking
[LeetCode's Cherry Pickup Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/cherry-pickup/description/) requires a program to be written that will navigate a grid from the top left to the bottom right and back, choosing the combination of paths that will result in the most cherries being picked up. In my solution, I utilize a Depth First Search approach to find all paths from the top left(0,0) to the bottom right(n-1, n-1). Then all combinations of paths are iterated over to find the maximum number of cherries that can be picked up on any combination. My solution also utilizes the Graphics.py library to give a visual representation of the grid. The grid can either be randomly generated, possibly resulting in no possible paths between (0,0) and (n-1,n-1), or can be manually defined via the `puzzle` variable. There is room for improvement here in order to optimize the solution, but this is a valid solution.
